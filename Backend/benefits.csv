"Kisan Credit Card","https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/kcc","Benefits
Fixation of credit limit/Loan amount
The short-term limit to arrive for the first year: For farmers raising a single crop in a year: Scale of finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical Committee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10% of limit towards post-harvest / household/consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance, PAIS & asset insurance.
Limit for second & subsequent year: First-year limit for crop cultivation purposes arrived at as above plus 10% of the limit towards cost escalation/increase in the scale of finance for every successive year ( 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year) and estimated Term loan component for the tenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years.
For farmers raising more than one crop in a year, the limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per the proposed cropping pattern for the first year and an additional 10% of the limit towards cost escalation/increase in the scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the remaining four years also. In case the cropping pattern adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be reworked. 
Term loans for investments towards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for the term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank’s judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.
The long-term loan limit is based on the proposed investments during the five-year period and the bank’s perception of the repaying capacity of the farmer 
Maximum Permissible Limit: The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and treated as the Kisan Credit Card Limit.
Fixation of Sub-limits for other than Marginal Farmers: 
Short-term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. Besides, at present, short-term crop loans are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/ Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme. Further, repayment schedules and norms are different for short-term and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short-term cash credit limit cum savings account and term loans. 
The drawing limit for short-term cash credit should be fixed based on the cropping pattern and the amounts for crop production, repairs and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn at the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point in time, the total liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year. 
Wherever the card limit/liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may take suitable collateral as per their policy."

"National Scheme Of Welfare Of Fishermen","https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nswf","Benefits
Here are the features and benefits that this government scheme for fishermen offers -

Housing Facility
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen offers fishermen facilities for constructing houses. There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed ₹75,000.

Construction of Common Facility
This government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within ₹2 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.

Assurance of Clean Drinking Water
This scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.

Insurance Facility
(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory ₹50,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides ₹25,000 for partial permanent disability.

Here, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth ₹15 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.

On the other hand, those States/UT’s, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT’s.

Saving cum relief
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects ₹75 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total ₹600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth ₹600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month. Also, the ‘lean months’ provisions vary from a coastal area or marine area, which FISHCOPFED decides entirely.

Now that individuals know about this government scheme for fishermen, i.e. the National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen, they avail funds and construct houses of their own."
