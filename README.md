## Project Overview

This project, created for the EY Techathon, aims to **streamline public service delivery** for citizens who face challenges in accessing government schemes and services. Using **AI-driven solutions**, this platform simplifies the process of identifying and applying for government schemes.

### Key Features

- **Smart Data Extraction**:  
  Users can upload their Aadhaar card images, and the system will automatically extract details (name, address, age, etc.) using **PyTesseract**.
- **Manual Entry**:  
  Users can manually fill in their details like name, age, income, state, disability status, and category.
- **AI-Driven Eligibility Recommendations**:  
  Uses **Google GenAI (Gemini)** to intelligently recommend schemes based on the userâ€™s details.
- **Batch Processing**:  
  Efficiently processes thousands of schemes using batch evaluation for eligibility through **Gemini**.
- **Seamless Navigation**:  
  Each displayed scheme includes a link redirecting users to the official government site for more details and application.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: Provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for entering user details and viewing scheme recommendations.

### Backend

- **FastAPI**: Powers the APIs for integrating the frontend with the logic for eligibility calculation and scheme fetching.

### Data Management

- **PyTesseract**: Extracts text from Aadhaar card images for automated data input.
- **SQL Database**: Stores structured scheme data, securely encrypted.
- **Selenium**: Automates scraping of scheme details from [MyScheme.gov.in](https://myscheme.gov.in).

### AI Model

- **Google GenAI (Gemini)**: Evaluates eligibility for schemes based on complex rules using AI-driven content generation.
